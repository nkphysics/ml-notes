    "# Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apriori in 1 sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is an association rule learning algorithm that iteratively identifies frequent item associations in transactional datasets, and is commonly used in recommendation/suggestion systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The apriori algorithm is used when working with transactional data. This could be a dataset of literal business transactions to examine the behaviors of customers' purchasing habits. However, user activity on some web app could also be formated to be transactional data. The list of examples of transactional data is quite broad, and the point we need to get at is that a lot more than just literal financial or bartering transactions can be considered *transactional data*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of experimenting with the apriori algorithm we'll use the *Movielens* 100k dataset.\n",
    "After getting a portion of the dataset in the following cell, in the subsequent cell we perform basic association rule mining on the data."
